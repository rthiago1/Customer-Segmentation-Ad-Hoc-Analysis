# Customer Segmentation

<br>
<br>

## Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to implemeent a Customer Segmentation strategy using RFM analysis. By categorizing customers based on their purchasing behavior, we aim to identify key customer segments such as high-value customers, at-risk and inactive customers. This analysis will provide actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and tailor promotional efforts for each segment to maximize revenue and enhance CLV.

### What is RFM Analysis?

RFM analysis is widely used by marketing teams to segment customers based on three key factors:

- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase
- **Frecency**: Indicates how often they buy
- **Monetary**: Measures how much money they spend


By analyzing these factors, we can help marketing team at targeted campaigns, customer retention, resource allocation, and data-driven decision making.
