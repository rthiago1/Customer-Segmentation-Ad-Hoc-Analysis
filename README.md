### What is RFM Analysis?

RFM analysis is widely used by marketing teams to segment customers based on three key factors:

- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase
- **Frecency**: Indicates how often they buy
- **Monetary**: Measures how much money they spend

### Stack I used for this project:

- **Python** to extract data from Excel (XLSX) files and load it into database. 
- **SQLite** database for structured storage.
- **SQL** for ETL processes and exploratory data analysis, while the final results are exported into CSV format.
- **Power BI** for building and developing interactive dashboard to visualize key insights.

### Key Highlights:

- The analysis period spans from **01-12-2010** to **09-12-2011**.
- The focus is on customers based in the United Kingdom.
- The project follows the CRISP-DM framework to ensure structured and consistent progress throughout the analysis.
- This is not the final version, as continuous improvements can always be made to refine the analysis.
